# Mise 🍳

> *From "mise en place" — the chef's practice of preparing everything before cooking.*

A modern recipe sharing platform built with Astro 5, React, and Convex. Share your culinary creations with the world.

**This is a complete rewrite of [RecipeSwap](https://github.com/dacrab/RecipeSwap)**, my original HTML/CSS/JS school project, now rebuilt as a full-stack application.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** [Convex](https://convex.dev/) (Database, Auth, File Storage)
- **Deployment:** [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/)
